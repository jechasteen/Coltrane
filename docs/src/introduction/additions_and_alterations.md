# Additions and Alterations

## Additions

Chords are not limited to three notes; we can add notes above the chord in thirds (3 or 4 semitones). The most common of these alterations is the 7th, which comes in two variants: the Major 7, and the Dominant 7. We can continue upward to the 9, 11, and 13 before coming full circle. Note that these notes are the same as the 2, 4, and 6.

Again, we must make an assumption. We assume that any chord with alterations `(7, b9, #13, etc.)` contain the diatonic tones in between. That is, a `#13` chord also contains `[7, 9, 11]`. The intended side-effect of this approach is that the language is equipped to analyze jazz compositions rather than generalized for a broader approach. The language can be used with or without chord alterations for any tonal or atonal composition, it simply makes assumptions about chord spellings that are based upon the jazz idiom.

The reasoning behind this decision is simple and pragmatic: we intend to draw scales from these expressions, so the language forces you to be specific. The "color" of the chord and scale is based upon these extension notes, so it is very important that the language is concrete in the referencing of extension notes. Any chord can be spelled through alteration expressions, but for brevity and ergonomics we can omit any diatonic extentions between the 7th and the last alteration.
