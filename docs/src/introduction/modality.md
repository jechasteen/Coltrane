# Modality

Looking at the key signature, for many charts, doesn't tell the entire story.
Each key has 7 degrees, each of which is a key in its own right.
We call these keys modes.

| Degree | Mode |
|--------|------|
|I|Ionian|
|ii|Dorian|
|iii|Phyrigian|
|IV|Lydian|
|V|Mixolydian|
|vi|Aeolian|
|vii|Locrian|

While there may be other more colorful modes, these are ones we are concerned with in Coltrane; the are based on the major scale.
Whether or not to use a mode is left to the discretion of the Coltrane composer, but it makes the most sense to determine the mode (if it is a mode) and write the code accordingly.

The same numbering process described in [Natural Triads](natural_triads.md) be done starting at any degree of the scale. Start a new count from `I/i`, matching the quality of the major scale at that degree. For example, the aeolean mode or natural minor:

| Major | Minor |
|-------|-------|
| `I`   | `III` |
| `ii`  | `iv`  |
| `iii` | `v`   |
| `IV`  | `VI`  |
| `V`   | `VII` |
| `vi`  | `i`   |
| `vii` | `ii`  |
