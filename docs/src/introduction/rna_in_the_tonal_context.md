### RNA in the Tonal Context

We derive the tonal center for a composition by the key provided by the composer. From that point, we draw a diatonic scale in the specified key. We then compare each chord's root to the scale. If the note lies on the scale, great, spell the natural triad upon that root and assess its triad category.

If the note falls a semitone below a note of the scale, we have a decision to make. We can label the chord as either flat or sharp. It would be typical to call it a flat in a flat key, or sharp in a sharp key, but for the sake of spelling the chord, it does not matter.

Remember, composers can pick any triad at any time. This approach should be seen as an asset for the need of expressing a composition's chord progression. It is imperative that we do not impart any bias to the chord progression. Unless we are the composer, we will impart or own biases when preparing an analysis.
