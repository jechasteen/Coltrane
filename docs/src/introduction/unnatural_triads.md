# Unnatural Triads

In practice, chord progressions are not limited to the natural triads. 
Composers are at liberty to choose whatever quality of triad, in whatever inversion, with whatever additions or alterations, at whatever point in the chromatic scale, at any time in a progression with complete disregard for conventional tonality. The roman numeral system does not directly address this fact. To reiterate, we are expressing a relationship to the **current key**.

Still, we must be able to represent chords that do not belong to a key. The cornerstone of tonal music, the `V-I` authentic cadence, creates a feeling of resolution. It is common for a composer to "target" a certain degree as if resolving to that key using what is known as a borrowed chord. We borrow the `V` from the following degree as if it were a major key. Consider: `A Dm G C` and `VI ii V I`. This is how the Coltrane language represents a "five of two" and other borrowed chords.

That does not inherently limit a song to a single key, of course. We simply must be content with referencing chords in terms of **semitones from tonic**. To be more specific, unless the composer specifies an explicit key change, we require that chords be expressed in the context of the specified key.
