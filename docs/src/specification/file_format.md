# File Format

At a glance, Coltrane would appear to be a toml file, with its ini-style sections, but there are only two permitted headings: `[meta]` and `[changes]`.

* The file ending for the language is `.chg`, which is short for changes.
* The file must be in utf-8 encoding with Unix line endings.
