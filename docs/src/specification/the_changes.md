# The Changes

This section is where language itself is used.
Each line represents a measure in the song, meaning that the song is linebreak delimited.
It is required that there be no more than one *Measure* statement per line.
There can be any number of *Chord* expressions within that line. Each line within the changes section is a discrete statement.
These statements can either be control flow or measures.
