# Metadata

A source file begins with a header that details the composition's metadata. There are required and optional fields.

Required fields:
```
[meta]
title=A Night In Tunisia
by=Dizzy Gillespie
meter=4/4
```

Optional Fields:
```
key=F
mode=Mixolydian
```

Each line must be in the format [key]=[value], but it also supports spaces before and after the equals: [key] = [value].
