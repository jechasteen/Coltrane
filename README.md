# Coltrane

Coltrane is a language for expressing the abstracted chord progression and linear control flow of musical compositions.
Coltrane is written in a simple, human-readable plain text format using [roman numeral analysis (RNA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numeral_analysis) tokens and control flow structures.
John Coltrane, for the uninitiated, was a saxophonist who they say practiced 12 hours a day and was 20 feet tall.
The motivation behind the development of this language is to help us to find new relationships between chords and musical lines **by playing our  instruments**.

## Current Status

Read the work-in-progress [white paper](https://jechasteen.github.io/Coltrane).

The license will be "all rights reserved" until release at which time it will be open source, likely the BSD 3-clause license.
As if yet, there is no API to speak of.
In the future, Coltrane will parse a source file and return a data structure that developers can integrate into their programs.

While this repository is configured as a Rust lib, there is no code yet. Soon :)

If this sounds interesting to you, I would appreciate a star! :)
